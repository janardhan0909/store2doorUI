	        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Mr.Green Store, we take great pride in our mission to create a healthy environment, thereby producing healthy and contented products.
	        <br><br><u>Store2Door Chicken (Free range country chicken):</u><br><br>
	        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our chickens are regularly rotated to a fresh paddock of grass. Grass-fed animals produce naturally leaner meats with the added benefits of beta-carotene, Omega-3 fatty acids and CLA. The anti-oxidant Vitamin E, which is derived from fresh pasture, is a bonus for our customers.
	        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of our animals are handled humanely from the day they are born. They are never fed animal by-products, given growth hormones or antibiotics. In addition, the pastures have not been chemically fertilized or treated with pesticides and herbicides.
	        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a beautiful, healthy environment where all the animals are able to flourish, naturally.
	        <br><br><u>Mr.Green Oils (Marachekku oils):</u>
	        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100% Natural Edible oils: Groundnut Oil, Coconut Oil & Gingelly Oil
	        <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood pressed oil finds a mention in Tamil Sangam literature as a healing agent for wounds. That is proof of the healing powers of the wood. It absorbs heat and maintains atmospheric temperature in oil extraction. The cold-pressed oil this way is packed with Nutrients and health benefits, something which our Ancestors enjoyed.
	        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a family friendly environment where you are welcome to visit the shop and see the oil manufacturing. Please confirm when calling so that a staff member or a family-member will be available to assist you at the place.
